While Libra will be available for multiple online purchasing systems (Uber, Lyft, Spotify, etc.), one of its primary use cases is to overtake normal currency in the Facebook marketplace. On the surface, this is beneficial; the introduction of a universal currency to this platform would allow people from opposite sides of the world to make purchases from one another. However, the fact that Facebook's Marketplace ties in with Facebook's own Novi Wallet and people's Facebook accounts mean that every purchase made using that system can be quite easily tied to someone's identity.
