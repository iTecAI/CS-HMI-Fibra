# Wallets

Most cryptocurrency systems must be accessed via specialized programs called wallets, that allow a user to view and modify their own funds in the network. My own Fibra implementation only allows one wallet for simplicity's sake, but most are open to third-party applications serving as wallets (Libra White Paper).

## The Issue With Libra's Wallet System

Like most other cryptocurrencies, the Libra Wallet system is open to multiple third-party wallet systems. However, this fact is fairly unlikely to come into play, as Facebook themselves are developing the Novi Wallet (previously Calibra) to mesh with their own systems and allow users to easily utilize their Libra. While this is *technically* a good thing due to its simplicity and ease of use, it has serious privacy issues inherent to its design (Facebook's Calibra Rebrands to Novi).

As Novi wallet data will be stored in Facebook's systems along with connections to Facebook users' accounts, it will be trivial for Facebook to track purchases across the entire extent of their user base. While this might not be an issue, it is highly likely that this valuable data would be sold to advertisers with little regard for consumer privacy. Furthermore, the fact that Novi will likely hold the majority market share of the Libra wallets available, Facebook is highly likely to make large amounts of money off of Libra transactions based on cuts of the profits, ad revenue, and other such sources of income (Facebook's Calibra Rebrands to Novi).
