**User Purchases**
The News section serves as a satirical method of displaying the privacy implications a system like Novi and Libra would cause. Although individual user purchase data would likely not be shown to other users, it's likely that it would be extensively sold to advertising agencies and statistical analysts. Though this would likely benefit the user experience, it would be a serious blow to individual privacy. If Libra proceeded to the point where it replaced or at least overtook conventional currency, it would mean that most of the average consumer's purchasing history would be easily viewable to Facebook, the Libra Association, and their clients. As the system is centralized, this data would also be subsceptible to leaks and cyberattacks, possibly leaking damaging information about Libra users to the general public.

**Breaking News - Fibra/Libra Association**
A fact that has not yet been addressed is that the Libra Association has complete control over the conversion rate between Libra and various currencies. While this might not be too much of an issue, there is very little stopping them from manipulating prices to keep people within the system, or make themselves some easy money. The whitepaper indicates that this won't happen, but that is (for all intents and purposes) little better than a spoken arrangement (Libra White Paper).
