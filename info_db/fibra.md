# Fibra

## Premise
**Fibra** is a satirical and informative web-based simulation meant to emulate the simple functions of Libra, a centralized cryptocurrency created by the Libra Association of Facebook. "Fibra" is derived from "Fib" and "Libra" (*Libra White Paper*). The **Fibra** system implements multi-user collaboration to simulate this system, using a number of randomly-acting bots to fill in the gaps.

## Simulation Elements
- **Users**
  Users are tracked by browser cookies that maintain their sessions between browser and page reloads. Both the Bots and Users utilize the same class structure, meaning that they can interact between eachother easily.
- **Bots**
  Bots are controlled by an asynchronous routine that runs every five seconds, causing each bot to randomly add items to the Marketplace or purchase items from Users.
- **Marketplace**
  Items can be bought and sold in the Marketplace, which shows their cost and relevant information.
- **Wallet**
  The Wallet allows you to view your current Fibra and Dollars, and convert between them in the Fund Converter.
- **News**
  This panel shows news updates, which may include other people's purchases and information on the Fibra Association.
